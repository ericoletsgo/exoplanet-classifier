# Accuracy Fix: From 95% to 83%

## The Problem You Discovered

You were absolutely right to question the 95% accuracy! It was **too good to be true**.

## What Was Wrong

### Before (Incorrect):
1. **Training**: Model trained on full dataset using cross-validation
2. **Evaluation**: Metrics calculated on the **same full dataset**
3. **Result**: 95% accuracy (inflated due to data leakage)

This is called **evaluation data leakage** - testing on data the model has already seen.

### Why This Happened:
- The training script used cross-validation (good practice)
- But the API's `/metrics` endpoint evaluated on the entire dataset
- The model was essentially "grading its own homework"

## The Fix

### After (Correct):
1. **Training**: Split data into 80% train, 20% test
2. **Train only on training set** (7,651 samples)
3. **Evaluate only on held-out test set** (1,913 samples the model has never seen)
4. **Result**: 83% accuracy (true performance)

## Real Performance Metrics

### Overall Performance:
- **Accuracy**: 82.6% (not 95%)
- **Precision**: 82%
- **Recall**: 83%
- **F1 Score**: 82%

### Per-Class Breakdown:
```
                  precision    recall  f1-score   support
  False Positive       0.87      0.89      0.88       968
       Candidate       0.65      0.56      0.60       396
Confirmed Planet       0.86      0.92      0.89       549
```

### Key Insights:
- **False Positives**: Model is very good at identifying these (87% precision)
- **Confirmed Planets**: High recall (92%) - catches most real planets
- **Candidates**: Hardest to classify (65% precision, 56% recall)
  - This makes sense - candidates are ambiguous by nature!

## Is 83% Good?

**Yes!** Here's why:

1. **Realistic**: This is the true performance on unseen data
2. **Balanced**: Works well across all three classes
3. **Useful**: 83% is much better than random guessing (33%)
4. **Honest**: We're not overstating the model's capabilities

## What Changed in the Code

### 1. Training Script (`fast_proper_training.py`):
```python
# NEW: Proper train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Train ONLY on training data
optimized_model = create_fast_ensemble(X_train, y_train, feature_names)

# Evaluate ONLY on test data
y_pred = optimized_model.predict(X_test)
test_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Save test set for later evaluation
joblib.dump({'X_test': X_test, 'y_test': y_test}, 'data/test_set.joblib')
```

### 2. API Metrics Endpoint (`api/main.py`):
```python
# NEW: Load held-out test set
test_set_path = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "test_set.joblib")
if os.path.exists(test_set_path):
    test_data = joblib.load(test_set_path)
    X = test_data['X_test']
    y = test_data['y_test']
    # Now metrics are calculated on unseen data!
```

## How to Apply

The model has already been retrained with the fix. Just restart the servers:

```bash
.\start.ps1
```

Now the metrics page will show the **real** 83% accuracy on the held-out test set.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always use a held-out test set** - Never evaluate on training data
2. **Be skeptical of high accuracy** - If it seems too good, investigate
3. **Stratified splits** - Maintain class distribution in train/test
4. **Save test sets** - Keep them separate for honest evaluation

## Thank You!

Your skepticism caught a real issue. The model is now evaluated honestly, and 83% is a solid, realistic performance metric.
